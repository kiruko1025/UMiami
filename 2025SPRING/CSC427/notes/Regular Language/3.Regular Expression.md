$\text{RegExp} X \iff M_{X}$  
$S \subseteq \sum ^{2}$ 
Also recognize same language as finite automata
### Defined recursively a alphabet $\Sigma$ 
1. $a \in \Sigma$ is a $R$.E
2. $\epsilon$ is a $R$.$E$.
3. $\emptyset$ is a $R$.$E$.
4. $(R_{1} \cup R_{2})$ is a $R$.$E$. given both are $R$.$E$.
5. $(R_{1}\circ R_{2})$ is a $R$.$E$. given both are $R$.$E$.
6. $(R^{k})$ 
### $E$.$g$.
$0^{*} 10^{*}$ - some 0, one 1, some 0 
$0^{*}10^{*}10^{*}$ - string with two ones 
$((0 \cup 1)(0 \cup 1))^{*}$ - 0 and multiples of 2 length string 



### Generalized nondeterministic finite automaton
•The start state has transition arrows going to every other state but no arrows
coming in from any other state.
•There is only a single accept state, and it has arrows coming in from every
other state but no arrows going to any other state. Furthermore, the accept
state is not the same as the start state.
•Except for the start and accept states, one arrow goes from every state to
every other state and also from each state to itself.

Turn DFA to GNDA by adding start and end with $\epsilon$ , union, and $\emptyset$ to every state 

### Turn FA into $R$.$E$.
follow operation rules [[1.Finite Automaton]]

Generalized Nondeterministic Finite Automata GNFA
Arrows are labelled with $R$.$E$.
All states have all possible arrows, if no connection put empty set, suppressed for simplicity when drawing
except:
- A unique start state that goes to all other states, without incoming arrows
- A unique accept state with arrow from all other states and no out going states
