#### Non-deterministic Turing Machine
recognize same language as deterministic 
#### Connect $S\circ T$ by $\epsilon$  
A non-deterministic finite automaton is a 5-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\delta, q_{0},F)$
1. $Q$ is a finite set called the **states**
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the **alphabet**
3. $\delta:Q\times \Sigma_{\epsilon}\to Pr(Q)$ is the **transition function**
4. $q_{0}\in Q$ in the **start state**
5. $F\subseteq Q$ is the **set of accept states**

The power set of $Q$: $Pr(Q)=\{ \emptyset,\{ q_{1} \},\dots \{ q_{1},q_{2} \},\dots \{ q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},q_{4}  \}\}$ 

#### One input can go to multiple destinations
$\left\{  S\in \sum ^{*}|\text{1011 is a substring}\right\}$ 

#### Theorem
Any NFA can be turned into DFA
DFA can be turned into NFA by going no where when $\epsilon$ 

Proof by power machine construction
$N=\left\{  Q,\sum_{\epsilon}, \delta,q_{0},F  \right\}$ 
$M=\left\{  Q',\sum,\delta',q_{0}',F'  \right\}$ 
$Q'=Pr(Q)$ 
The deterministic machine will have states that contains all possible states in the non-deterministic machine
