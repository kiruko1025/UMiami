### Definition
$S$ is a set 
A binary operation * is operation on S that associate each ordered pair $(s_{1},s_{2})\in S$
a unique a element $S$ denoted by $s_{1}*s_{2}\in S$
No way to make all 4 operation work - subtract and divide

A binary operation can be 
commutative
associative
(both or only one or none)
$2(a+b)$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ is associative but not commutative  
### Examples
In $S=\mathbb{Z}_{+}$ +ve integers
$a+b$ is a binary operation
$a-b$ is not
$a\cdot b$ is
$\frac{a}{b}$ is not

In $S=\mathbb{Z}$ all integers
$a+b$ is
$a-b$ is
$a\cdot b$ is
$\frac{a}{b}$ is not (not int and divide 0)

$S=Q$ rationals
$a+b$ is
$a-b$ is
$a\cdot b$ is
$\frac{a}{b}$ is not (no divide 0)

$S=Q_{+}$ +ve rational
$a+b$ is
$a-b$ is not
$a\cdot b$ is
$\frac{a}{b}$ is

$X$ is a set and $S$ is the set of all subset of $X$ (power set)
$X=\{ 1,\dots,n \}$ $S$ has $2^n$ element
Note: $X=\emptyset$ then $S=\{ \emptyset \}$ $n=0$ but $2^0=1$

These are all binary operation and commutative and associative
$A\cap B$ intersection
$A\cup B$ union
$A- B$ difference
$A\triangle B$ symmetric difference

$S=$ the set of $2\times 2$ matrices
$A\cdot B$ matrix multiplication only one 
associative but not commutative

$S=$ all possible

| a\b | 1   | 2   | ... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | a11 | a12 | ... |
| 2   | a21 | a22 |     |
| ... | ... |     |     |
$n^{n^2}$ number of operations
number of commutative is symmetric is
$n^{n(n+1)/2  }$  
$1+2+3+4+\dots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ 
number of associative - no formula but 
$n=1$ is 1
$n=2$ is 8
$n=3$ is 113
$n=4$ is 3492
