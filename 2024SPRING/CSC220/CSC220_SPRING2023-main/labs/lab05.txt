0. You should have prog05 in IntelliJ.  If not, reboot your computer
   and restart the OneDrive app so you are syncing.  Ask for help if you
   have problems.

   Run prog05/MaintainQueue and make sure you know how it works.
   The "position" button won't work until you do step #1.
   Add a few people, peek, remove, etc.
   What happens when you peek at an empty queue?


1. Implement the "position" button (case 4).  Use the logic given and
   the new for-loop you learned about in lecture.  Test.
   

2. Download ArrayQueue.java, read and understand offer and poll.  This
   means that you are ready to write either of them on the quiz.
   Implement peek.  What should be the new values of first and size?

   Switch MaintainQueue to using ArrayQueue.  Make sure it is working.
   It won't print the list (and position won't work) because the
   special loop won't work for ArrayQueue until you implement
   iterator.  Also, because you don't reallocate and the capacity is
   five, if you add six people, the sixth person will become first in
   line!


3. Implement the (internal) Iter class that implements Iterator<E>.
 
   a. What condition on count tells us that hasNext should return
      true?

   b. Implement next().

   c. Test MaintainQueue again.  The special for-loop and hence the
      "position" button should work and it should print out the queue.
      Why?  Because AbstractQueue toString uses YOUR Iterator.


4. Finish implementing reallocate() in ArrayQueue using the new type
   of for-loop.  Remember, inside a class, its name is this.  Try
   adding more than five elements in MaintainQueue.  (Or just run
   ArrayQueue.)

   Test using TestArrayQueue.


5. Run prog05.jar (double-click on it).  Play the game as a human.
   Can you get from lead to gold?  pass to fail?  trash to money?
   Does the computer get there in fewer words?

   Create a class NotWordle.  Its constructor should take a
   UserInterface and store it in a class variable.

public class NotWordle { // NotWordle class
  UserInterface ui; // class variable

  NotWordle (UserInterface ui) { // constructor that takes a UserInterface
    this.ui = ui; // and stores it in a class variable
  }

   In its main method, create a new NotWordle with a new GUI and store
   the NotWordle in game.  Ask the user for a starting word and a
   target word.  Ask if the human or the computer should play:

    String[] commands = { "Human plays.", "Computer plays." };

   Call game.play or game.solve with the starting word and the target
   word.  (solve will empty for now.)

   In play, do the following forever (until the return occurs).  Tell
   the user the current word (the start) and the target word.  Ask for
   the next word.  Set the start word variable to that next word.  If
   it equals the target, tell the user ``You win!'' and return.
   Otherwise keep looping.  Test.


5. peek in LinkedQueue is just the same as LinkedStack.  poll is just
   the same as pop except you should decrement size, and if top gets set
   to null, you should set bottom to null.

   If top is null, then offer sets both top and bottom to the same new
   Node.  Otherwise, it adds a new Node at the bottom.  That takes two
   lines, one to add a new Node as the next one below the current
   bottom, and another to set bottom to the new bottom.  Don't forget
   to increment size.

   Switch MaintainQueue to LinkedStack and test.  Printing and
   position won't work.


6. Implement Iter hasNext() and next().  Test using MaintainQueue.
   position should work now, and it should print the queue.

   Test using TestLinkedQueue.


HOMEWORK

10. In NotWordle, create a static boolean method differByOneLetter which
   takes two String as input and returns true if they have the same
   length and differ in exactly one character.

   Modify play so that it calls differByOneLetter.  It should warn
   the user and NOT change the current (start) word variable if the
   word that the user suggests is not one letter away from the current
   start word.  Test.


11. In NotWordle main, just after creating the new NotWordle in main, ask the
   user for the name of a word file and call game.loadWords(filename).
   Add a private internal Node class to NotWordle with a String word and an
   Node next.  Add a List<Node> wordEntries to NotWordle initialized to an
   ArrayList<Node>.  For each word in the word file, loadWords should
   read in the word, create a Node from it, and add this Node to
   wordEntries.

   Write a find method that takes a String word and finds that word in
   wordEntries.  It should return the node for that word or null if
   not there.  Modify play so it also refuses a word not in words.
   Test using the file called words.txt in the prog05 directory:
   move it to the csc220 IntelliJ project folder (IdeaProjects/csc220).


11. Now to implement NotWordle.solve.  Inside solve, create a Queue of
   Node.  Find the node belonging to the start word and put it into
   the queue.  Also save it in a variable since you will need to refer
   to it again later.

   While the queue is not empty, remove a node, and call it theNode.
   Go through the list wordEntries and look for entries which aren't
   the start node, have next equal to null, and are one letter
   different from theNode.  For each one you find, call it nextNode.
   Set nextNode next to theNode and add nextNode to the queue.

   If the word in nextNode is the target, then report success.  To get
   the solution in reverse order, follow next back to the start
   node.  Display the solution in forward order.

   Test using TestNotWordle.
