1. ArrayMap is a "proper" version of SortedPD.  It implements
   Map<String, String>.  Finishing implementing ArrayMap.find.
   It should run in O(log n) time for n = size.

   Implement found.

2. Finish implementing ArrayMap.add.  Run it to test.  (Remove won't
   work.)  Correct output in arraymap-add.txt.

3. Finish implementing ArrayMap.remove.  Run it to test.  Correct
   output in arraymap-remove.txt.

4. Look at FileMap.containsKey.  Ask questions.  Implement get.
   Only two lines are slightly different.

5. Finish implementing FileMap.put.  Correct output in
   filemap-put.txt.

6. Finish implementing BTree.put.  Correct output in btree-put.txt.


HOMEWORK

7. Copy Jumble.java to prog09.  Change package to prog09 on the first
   line if it doesn't happen automatically.  Test words.txt and
   dict.txt with BTree.

8. Finish implementing FileMap.join.  Make sure you understand
   FileMap.split first.

9. Finish implementing FileMap.remove.  Correct output in
   filemap-remove.txt.

10. Finish implementing BTree.remove.  Correct output in
   btree-remove.txt.
