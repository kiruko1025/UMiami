0. Give a Java expression in terms of the integers 31, 'c', 'a', and 't' for the
   hash code of the String "cat".  Don't use ^ or pow.




1. Write a method which calculates the hash code of a String using a prime p
   other than 31.  Don't use ^ or pow.

	int hashCode (String s, int p) {













2. Write the method that calculates the hash index for a String s for a hash
   table of length m.  Use the default hashCode method for String.

	int hashIndex (String s, int m) {









3. If n=m-1 items are stored in a chained hash table of length m, what is the
   expected O() time to determine that an item with key "Victor" is *not* in the
   table?  What is the worst O() time?




4. Same question as #3 for an open addressed hash table?  Assume all unused
   locations are null (no "traffic cones").




5. An open addressed hash table contains the following keys (data not shown).
   find(key) returns the index of the key or where it should be inserted if it is
   not there.  DELETED is the "traffic cone".  hashIndex("pup")==7 and
   hashIndex("nit")==5.  What are find("pup") and find("nit")?

[0] "cat", [1] "dog", [2] null, [3] "rat", [4] null, [5] "ant", [6] DELETED, [7] "bug"




6. If hashIndex("dog")=6, what is find("dog")?  What would it be if someone
   incorrectly removed "cat" by setting table[0]=null?






7. The following Name class will be the key for either a TreeMap or HashMap:

     	public class Name implements Comparable<Name> {
	    private String first, last;

            public Name (String first, String last) {
		this.first = first;
		this.last = last;
	    }

   Implement an equals method for Name using the standard rule that two people
   have the same name if they have the same first name and the same last name.
   ****DO NOT CREATE ANY NEW STRINGS IN YOUR ANSWERS TO 7, 8, and 9.****

            public boolean equals (Object o) {
		Name that = (Name) o;
		boolean firstEqFirst = this.first.equals(that.first);
		boolean lastEqLast = this.last.equals(that.last);
                // ONE LINE:







8. Implement the compareTo method.  This should correspond to the standard way
   to alphabetize people's names:  John Jones < Jane Smith < John Smith.

            public int compareTo (Name that) {
		int firstCmpFirst = this.first.compareTo(that.first);
		int lastCmpLast = this.last.compareTo(that.last);

                if (                                                       )

                    return                                                      ;

                else

                    return                                                      ;





9. Implement hashCode.  It should combine the hash code of the first and last
   name.  People with names ``Bernard Frank'' and ``Frank Bernard'' should not
   hash to the same value.  (Hint:  why isn't "BF".hashCode() == "FB".hashCode()?)

            public int hashCode () {
		int firstCode = this.first.hashCode();
		int lastCode = this.last.hashCode();
		// ONE LINE:
